Day 1:

I read and completed the first section (part-0) of fullstackopen.
Since I wasn't spending time on web techonologies lately, I wanted to refresh my frontend skills before starting to the course.
I also did this because I didn't want to be frustrated. I want to increase the difficulty gradually. 
I created a one-week HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS plan to practice those techonologies. 
I'll start to follow it tomorrow.

In terms of English, I watched a couple of tech-related videos from Theo.gg and learning related videos from Justin Sung.
I really like Justin's videos. He gives good advice about learnign to learn and time management.
I also created 34 new Anki cards to study tomorrow. Tomorrow will be my first Anki review day.
See you tomorrow!
